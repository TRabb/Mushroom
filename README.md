This is my first attempt at game development using GDScript. The goal is to create a Rougelike Tower Defense game, lets see what I can do!


Functionality that I would like to add:

**Decide on some sort of theme and art style**

**UI Related:**
- Start menu
- In-game UI elements such as user HP, currency, timer, start wave/pause wave
- You lost menu
  
**Tower Related:**
- ~~Towers automatically attack any enemy within range~~
- ~~Towers have their own stats (Attack speed, range, damage)~~
- Towers can only be placed when user has enough currency

**Enemy Related:**
- ~~Wave system~~
- ~~Enemies have their own stats (Health, speed)~~
- Enemies drop currency that user spends to buy towers

**Rougelike Related:**
- After each wave the user upgrades a certain stat of the enemy
- After completing a set of waves the user can increase a stat of a turret
  - Both of these will carry over between sets of waves
- Better map generation, some ideas include
  - Loops
  - Multiple paths intersecting

No real end goal for this other then to learn!
