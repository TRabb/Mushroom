This is my first attempt at game development using GDScript. The goal is to create a Rougelike Tower Defense game, lets see what I can do!


Functionality that I would like to add:

**Decide on some sort of theme and art style**
Idea: You are a peasant with the dream of running your own village. You start with everything you own, which isn't much, and you must defend your land from medieval creatures trying to ruin your destiny.
The end of the path is the beginning of your empire. How long will you last?

**Menu Related:**
- Create backgrounds for all menus
- Pause menu
- In-game UI elements such as ~~user HP~~, ~~currency~~, timer, start wave/pause wave
  
**Tower Related:**
- ~~Towers automatically attack any enemy within range~~
- ~~Towers have their own stats (Attack speed, range, damage)~~
- ~~Towers can only be placed when user has enough currency~~
- ~~Tooltip that shows tower stats when placing~~
  - Could include the active modifiers this tower has. This would need to show somewhere when user is not placing a tower

**Enemy Related:**
- ~~Wave system~~
- ~~Enemies have their own stats (Health, speed)~~
- ~~Enemies drop currency that user spends to buy towers~~
- Tooltip that shows enemy stats
  - Could be similar to a enemy dictionary where after you kill them you know their stats permanently
  - Could include the modifiers that this enemy can recieve once you have applied it once

**Rougelike Related:**
- After each wave the user modifies a certain stat of the enemy
- After completing a set of waves the ~~user can modifies a stat of a turret~~
  - Both negative and positive modifiers
  - Both enemy and tower modifiers will carry over between sets of waves
 
**Miscellaneous:**
- Better map generation, some ideas include
  - Loops
  - Multiple paths intersecting
  - River that goes top down that can also spawn enemies
  - Different types of terrain that can spawn to block tower placement. These can also be used as areas only certain towers can be placed
  - **BALANCE BALANCE BALANCE!**
  
No real end goal for this other then to learn!
